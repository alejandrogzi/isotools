//! Core module for segmenting reads based on their polyA features
//! Alejandro Gonzales-Irribarren, 2025
//!
//! This module contains the main functions for grouping reads
//! and processing components based on polyA features in parallel.
//!
//! In short, this modules provides iso-segment. The segment module
//! filters reads based on alignment quality and predicts the polyA
//! tail using a two-state HMM model.
